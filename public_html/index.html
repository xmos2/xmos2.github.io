		    		<p class="intro">This web page will in short discuss my cats and their various personalities. They are all litter mates (supposedly Merlin has a different birthdate so odds are they might have put an extra in the cage) If you wish to acquire some fluffy friends of your own I will provide some links to some local animal shelters.</p>

		<p class="merlin">Merlin as stated before might not be actually related by blood to the other two but regardless he is a part of the family now. Like all of them he is rather odd because he is really affectionate but only "secretly". By this I mean he really loves to cuddle but will sometimes run away the second someone else could see him doing it. He is also a big cat, not fat just large which is unfortunate because he is unaware of his size and really likes to sleep on a person's chest/face where he happily drools. He is also smart enough to figure out how to open doors which I think his size advantage might come into play there just a bit. He is unfortunately also the one most curious with the outside world so it's practically guarenteed to be greeted by him squeaking from the window before trying to get out.
